## JS Shopping List - About

In this challenge we want to make a simple shopping list example that allows you to dynamically add items to the list using a form input and button. When you add an item to the input and press the button:

- The item should appear in the list.
- Each item should be given a button that can be pressed to delete that item off the list.
- The input should be emptied and focused ready for you to enter another item.
